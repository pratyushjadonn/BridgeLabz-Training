📋 📌 Day 1 – 16 December 2025

On the first day, I officially started the Bridgelabz Training Program . The focus of the session was on building a strong foundational understanding of the tools and practices required for the training.

 1.Introduction to the Java development environment, including setup and configuration

 2.Overview of Git and GitHub, covering basics of version control and repository management

 3. Understanding code tracking and collaboration using Git

 4.Explanation of project structure and coding standards to ensure clean, organized, and maintainable code
 

📋 📌 Day 2 – 17 December 2025

On the second day of training, the focus was on organizing the project in a structured and maintainable manner for Core Java practice.

1.Created the initial folder structure for the training project

2.Organized all Java practice under the core-java-practice directory

3.Maintained a structured codebase inside the gcr-codebase folder

4.Created separate folders for different learning modules:

   #Programming Elements

   #Control Flow

   #LeetCode practice

   #Scenario-based problems

5.Ensured clarity, scalability, and proper organization of the project structure

📋 📌 Day 3 – 18 December 2025

On the third day of training, I completed the Level 1 and Level 2 assignments related to Programming Elements, focusing on strengthening the core fundamentals of Java programming.

1.Completed Level 1 and Level 2 assignments of Programming Elements

2.Practiced core concepts of variables and data types

3.Worked with operators for data manipulation

4.Implemented input and output operations in Java

5.Improved understanding of basic Java syntax and structure

6.Learned how data is stored, processed, and displayed in Java programs

7.Organized all completed assignments inside
  ===core-java-practice/gcr-codebase/programming-elements

📋 📌 Day 4 – 19 December 2025

On the fourth day of training, I completed the Level 1 and Level 2 assignments for the Control Flow module, focusing on implementing decision-making and looping logic in Java programs.

1.Completed Level 1 and Level 2 assignments of the Control Flow module

2.Practiced conditional statements including if, if-else, and switch

3.Worked with looping constructs such as for, while, and do-while

4.Developed logical and efficient programs to control the flow of execution

5.Implemented an example program DivisibilityByFive.java to demonstrate conditional logic

6.Organized all Control Flow assignments inside

📋 📌 Day 5 – 20 December 2025

On the fifth day of training, I completed the Level 3 assignments of the Control Flow module, strengthening my understanding of advanced decision-making and looping logic in Java programs.

Completed Level 3 assignments of the Control Flow module

Solved more complex problems using nested if-else and switch statements

Applied loops with conditions and logical operators to handle real-world scenarios

Improved problem-solving skills by writing optimized and structured Java programs

Implemented multiple programs to demonstrate effective control of program execution flow

Organized all Level 3 Control Flow assignments inside the same repository link: https://github.com/pratyushjadonn/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/core-java-practice/core-java-practice/gcr-codebase/control-flow

Also done 2 scenerio based question : link : https://github.com/pratyushjadonn/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/core-java-practice/core-java-practice/scenario-based

📋 📌 Day 6 – 21 December 2025

On the sixth day of training, I completed the Level 1 and Level 2 assignments of the Arrays module. This session focused on understanding array fundamentals in Java, including declaration, initialization, and traversal techniques. I practiced solving problems involving single-dimensional arrays to strengthen my logic-building and data handling skills. Through these assignments, I improved my ability to perform operations such as accessing elements, iterating using loops, and applying basic problem-solving strategies. All array-related assignments were properly organized inside the GCR folder to maintain a structured and readable codebase.

📋 📌 Day 7 – 22 December 2025

On the seventh day of training, I completed the Level 1 assignments of the Strings module. This session focused on understanding string fundamentals in Java, including string creation, immutability, and commonly used string methods. I practiced solving problems related to string traversal, comparison, concatenation, and basic manipulations to enhance my logical thinking and text-processing skills. Through these assignments, I improved my ability to work with character sequences and apply string operations effectively in problem-solving scenarios. All string-related Level 1 assignments were properly organized inside the GCR folder within the core-java-practice directory to maintain a clean and structured codebase.

📋 📌 Day 8 – 23 December 2025

On the eighth day of training, I successfully completed the Level 2 and Level 3 assignments of the Strings module. This session focused on advanced string operations in Java, including pattern-based logic, character frequency analysis, substring handling, and efficient manipulation of string data. I practiced solving more complex problems that required combining multiple string concepts and applying optimized logic. Through these assignments, I strengthened my problem-solving abilities and gained deeper confidence in handling real-world string-based scenarios. All Level 2 and Level 3 string assignments were systematically organized inside the GCR folder within the core-java-practice directory to ensure a well-structured and maintainable codebase.
